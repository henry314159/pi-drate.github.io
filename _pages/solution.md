## The Problem

Over-irrigation is a blight on the farming community and the environment at large. A 2008 University of Nebraska [study](https://cropwatch.unl.edu/documents/g1904.pdf) on the impacts of wet soil conditions due to over-irrigation (or flooding), has shown that excessive irrigation damages crops through nitrogen leaching and creating an environment favourable to weeds and disease. At the same time [40% of water](https://htt.io/water-usage-in-the-agricultural-industry/) used by the agriculture industry worldwide is wasted due to outdated irrigation techniques. Therefore a good solution to over-irrigation would both maximise crop yield for farmers and help to protect the environment, which is where our product steps in.
The need for efficiency in agriculture has never been more pressing than now, with worldwide poverty expected to increase, the global climate crisis, and the ever increasing global population; widespread use of efficient irrigation techniques is imperative.
